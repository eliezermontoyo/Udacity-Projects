          <h2 class="Session-Title">Session 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
            <div class="Session-Description">
              <p>On this lesson I learned how the <em>WWW</em> works and what it is
               composed of (<em>HTTP, Servers, Internet and Browser</em>). Then I 
               learned a little about <em>HTML</em>, some basic stuff like what it is 
               and the difference between what you see in a browser and the actual 
               code. I also saw that the <em>HTML Markup</em> is composed of elements 
               like tags and attributes and that there are some tags you can close and 
               other that don't need to be closed (<em>a,img,em,src,ect.</em>). Then 
               we went over the differences between inline and block elements.

          <h2 class="Session-Title">Session 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2>
            <div class="Session-Description">
              <p>On this lesson I learned how blocks in <em>HTML</em> work, how you can 
              see the different blocks that make up a <em>HTML</em> document using 
              developer tools in Google Chrome and that these blocks form an invisible 
              rectangular box around each element. Also I learned about the <em>DOM</em
              > or the "Document Object Model" and how it is used to make a <em>HTML</em> 
              into a tree-like structured document. Also this lesson explains that <em>
              HTML </em> and <em>CSS</em> are both languages used to create this 
              structure. I also got introduced to various text editor tools like; 
              Sublime Editor, Codepen and Scratchpad.

          <h2 class="Session-Title">Session 3: Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure</h2>
            <div class="Session-Description">
              <p>This lesson was my favorite! I learned how to add style to my <em>HTML
              </em> document using <em>CSS</em> or "Cascading Style Sheets" and how to 
              apply and edit them. I saw how important it is to avoid repetition by 
              using inheritance in css and how avoiding needless repetion makes it 
              easier to code and style. I learned how to use different resources to 
              find all the different types of properties used in <em>CSS</em> and also 
              learned how to use the "class" attribute to link a style to an element. 
              Then I saw how the box model works and how it affects different elements
              in the <em>HTML</em>. At the end of this lesson I learned how to use <em>
              HTML</em> with <em>CSS</em> and how to refine the basic properties used
              to make this <em>HTML</em> document.
