        <h2 class="Session">Session 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
        <div class="description">
          <p>On this lesson I learned how the <em>WWW</em> works and what it is
            composed of (<em>HTTP, Servers, Internet and Browser</em>). Then I 
            learned a little about <em>HTML</em>, some basic stuff like what it is 
            and the difference between what you see in a browser and the actual 
            code. I also saw that the <em>HTML Markup</em> is composed of elements 
            like tags and attributes and that there are some tags you can close and 
            other that don't need to be closed (<em>a,img,em,src,ect.</em>). Then we 
            went over the differences between inline and block elements.

        <h2 class="Session">Session 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2>
        <div class="description">
          <p>On this lesson I learned how blocks in <em>HTML</em> work, how you can 
            see the different blocks that make up a <em>HTML</em> document using 
            developer tools in Google Chrome and that these blocks form an invisible 
            rectangular box around each element. Also I learned about the <em>DOM</em>
            or the "Document Object Model" and how it is used to make a <em>HTML</em> 
            into a tree-like structured document. Also this lesson explains that <em>
            HTML </em> and <em>CSS</em> are both languages used to create this 
            structure. I also got introduced to various text editor tools like; 
            Sublime Editor, Codepen and Scratchpad.

        <h2 class="Session">Session 3: Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure</h2>
        <div class="description">
          <p>This lesson was my favorite! I learned how to add style to my <em>HTML
            </em> document using <em>CSS</em> or "Cascading Style Sheets" and how to 
            apply and edit them. I saw how important it is to avoid repetition by 
            using inheritance in css and how avoiding needless repetion makes it 
            easier to code and style. I learned how to use different resources to 
            find all the different types of properties used in <em>CSS</em> and also 
            learned how to use the "class" attribute to link a style to an element. 
            Then I saw how the box model works and how it affects different elements
            in the <em>HTML</em>. At the end of this lesson I learned how to use <em>
            HTML</em> with <em>CSS</em> and how to refine the basic properties used
            to make this <em>HTML</em> document.

        <h2 class="Session">Session 1: Introduction to "Serious" Programming</h2>
        <div class="description">
				  <p>On this lesson I learned the difference between machines and computers 
            and how computers can be programmed to do anything. These programs work by 
            breaking problems into smaller pieces and then building steps to solve each 
            piece. The example given to us in this session was with the programming 
            language <em>Python</em>, which is used to tell a computer what to do. <em>
            Python</em> is executed with a <em>Python Interpreter</em> which is another 
            program that runs the written code and converts it into a command that the 
            computer understands.
					</p>

					<p>In <em>Python</em> you can't just write anything and it will run. In <em>
            Python</em> you need to write everything with the correct <em>Grammar</em>, 
            if not the <em>Python Interpreter</em> won't run the written code. A <em>
            Python Expression</em> is a way to organize your code so that the <em>
            Python Interpreter</em> can understand your <em>Grammar</em>.

	    	<h2 class="Session">Session 2: Variables and Strings</h2>
	    	<div class="description">
					<p>On this lesson I was introduced to the <b>Variable</b>, which is a way 
            to assign a name to different stuff in <em>Python</em>, like strings or 
            expressions. For example: for the string <em>"hammer, nails, and glue"</em> 
            I can assign the variable <em>Tools</em> -> <b>Tools = "hammer,nails and 
            glue"</b>. Since I'm not a serious programmer yet, I can't say for certain 
            what are the real uses for this, but I believe it is used to make really 
            long expressions or strings into something more manageable. When assigning 
            a variable, the equals sign does not have the same function as in a 
            mathematical equation, instead it just gives a name to a value. So the 
            equals sign in 1-1=0 is not the same as food="cookies".
					</p>

					<p>I also learned about <b>Strings</b> which is a list of characters in 
            order, for example "Wikepedia". For the name Wikipedia to be a string it 
            has to be enclosed by quotes, which can be single (' '), double (""), or 
            triple(''' '''). Strings and regular expressions are different ways to 
            write code on <em>Python</em>, for example, it is not the same to write 
            \\print 1+1+1\\ and \\print '1'+'1'+'1'\\, the answers are different. The 
            first one will add the numbers 1 and the second one will combine all the 
            number 1s to print '111'. Also in this lesson I learned how to find a 
            specific character in a string with the function .find. This function will 
            print out the position in the string of whatever character your looking for 
            and also you can use it to find the occurence of that character, for 
            example, if I give a value to the variable Eli  (Eli = "A nice guy"), I can 
            use the .find function to find in what position does the word "nice" 
            starts; <em>print Eli.find ("nice")</em> the answer would be position 2, 
            because it is the first occurence of the word nice in my string.

        <h2 class="Session">Session 3: Input -> Function -> Output</h2>
        <div class="description">
          <p>On this lesson I learned what is a function or as Dave calls them 
            "procedures". A function is an expression used in python that starts by 
            defining inputs like numbers or strings, then it produces an output. The 
            first part of a function is the input, usually starting with the keyword 
            "ref", then the function name and last a parameter or parameters. Example:
            <span class="code">ref name(Parameter):</span>. After the input you have to 
            define the function output. In this lesson we practiced with the function 
            output "return". Example: <span class="code">return parameter + "s":</span>
            Then you could use print to see the result of you function. Example: <span 
            class="code">print name("ball")</span> the program would give back <span 
            class="code">"balls".</span></p>
            <p>Functions are very useful because they help avoid repetitions by reusing 
            them without having to write them again and you can use them with different 
            parameters. It is important to always have a return statement in your 
            functions. If you dont, the interpreter wont produce an output.
